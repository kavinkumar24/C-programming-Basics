////////////////          Good Program         /////////////////////

/* Problem
In computing, the collection of four bits is called a nibble.

Chef defines a program as: Good, if it takes exactly 

 X nibbles of memory, where X is a positive integer.
  Not Good, otherwise.
  Given a program which takes
N bits of memory, determine whether it is Good or Not Good.*/
